1. **Backend Not Running:**

   # If not running, start it
   cd /path/to/backend
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Frontend Not Updated:**
   ```bash
   # Refresh the browser page
   # Or restart the frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Network Issues:**
   - Check if both frontend (port 3002) and backend (port 8081) are running
   - Verify no firewall blocking local connections

4. **Data Issues:**
   - Make sure mobile numbers are unique (each user needs different number)
   - Use exactly 4 digits for password
   - Fill all required fields
