# 🐛 **Booking History Issue - FIXED!**

## 🔍 **Problem Identified:**
After a driver accepts a ride, the booking was not showing in the rider's booking history even though the API was returning the correct data.

## 🚨 **Root Cause:**
The booking utility functions `isActiveBooking` and `isPastBooking` were incorrectly implemented:

**Before (BROKEN):**
```javascript
export const isActiveBooking = (status) => {
  return status === "REQUESTED";
};

export const isPastBooking = (status) => {
  return status === "ACCEPTED" || status === "REJECTED";
};
```

**Problem:** These functions expected a status string, but were being called with the entire booking object.

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**
Updated the utility functions to properly handle booking objects:

**After (FIXED):**
```javascript
export const isActiveBooking = (booking) => {
  return booking.status === "REQUESTED";
};

export const isPastBooking = (booking) => {
  return booking.status === "ACCEPTED" || booking.status === "REJECTED";
};
```

## 🔧 **Additional Improvements:**
1. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive console logging to track data flow
2. **Better Error Handling**: Improved error reporting in BookingService
3. **API Validation**: Confirmed backend APIs are working correctly

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**
- ✅ **ACCEPTED bookings** will now appear in the "Past Rides" section
- ✅ **REQUESTED bookings** will appear in the "Current Rides" section  
- ✅ **REJECTED bookings** will appear in the "Past Rides" section

## 🧪 **Testing:**
- API Test: `/history/user/2` returns ACCEPTED booking ✅
- Frontend Fix: Utility functions now properly categorize bookings ✅

## 📱 **User Experience:**
After this fix, when a driver accepts a ride, the rider will immediately see it in their booking history under "Past Rides" section with status "Accepted".

**Your booking history should now work perfectly!**
